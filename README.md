# Structure_Analysis_direct_Stiffness_method
An analysis of a 2-D frame by Direct Stiffness Method. 
The DSM is based on the principles of matrix structural analysis.

- Define the structure: Identify the elements, nodes, and their connectivity.
- Define geometry and material properties.
- Define boundary conditions.
- Define loads.
- Form transformation matrix.
- Create the element stiffness matrix.
- Form the joint load matrix.
- Assemble the global stiffness matrix.
- Apply boundary conditions.
- Solve for displacements and reactions.
- Calculate member end forces.

By following these steps, the Direct Stiffness Method can be used to analyze and design 2-D frames for a variety of structural engineering applications such as bridges, buildings, and aircraft.
